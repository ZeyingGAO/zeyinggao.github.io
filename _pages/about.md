## 👋🏻 About Me
Hi! I am Zeying (Christine)!

I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Foreign Languages and Literatures at Tsinghua University, with a focus on language, psychology, and cognition. My research interests center around the development of social communication skills in both typical and atypical populations, including children with autism. I am particularly passionate about investigating how pragmatic reasoning, language processing, and social cognition contribute to children's social communication development, as well as exploring the familial, cognitive, and neural mechanisms that influence these processes.

My academic journey has been marked by my commitment to interdisciplinary research, combining insights from linguistics, psychology, and neuroscience to better understand the complexities of language development. 

In addition to my research, I have experience as a teaching assistant, where I have worked closely with international students to improve their language skills. I am also actively involved in community outreach, volunteering at organizations dedicated to supporting children with autism.

Through my academic and professional experiences, I strive to contribute to a deeper understanding of social communication development and to support the needs of children with diverse communication abilities.
