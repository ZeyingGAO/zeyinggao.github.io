## About Me

I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Foreign Languages and Literatures at Tsinghua University, with a focus on language, psychology, and cognition. My research interests center around **the development of social communication skills in both typical and atypical populations**, including children with autism. I am particularly passionate about investigating how **pragmatic reasoning, language processing, and social cognition** contribute to children's social communication development, as well as exploring **the cognitive, neural, familial, and cultural mechanisms that influence these processes**.

My academic journey has been marked by my commitment to **interdisciplinary research**, combining insights from linguistics, psychology, and neuroscience to better understand the complexities of language development. I am currently advised by [Professor Peng Zhou](https://peng-zhou.com/research/) of Child Cognition Lab at Zhejiang University (previsouly at Tsinghua University). I was advised by [Professor Jing Zhao](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=JBzKh54AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) of Child Language and Literacy Lab at Sun Yat-sen University from 2020 to 2022.

In addition to my research, I have experience as a teaching assistant, where I have worked closely with international students to improve their language skills. I am also actively involved in community outreach, volunteering at organizations dedicated to supporting autistic children.

Through my academic and professional experiences, I strive to contribute to a deeper understanding of social communication development and to support the needs of children with diverse communication abilities.
