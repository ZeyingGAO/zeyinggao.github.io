Main Research Projects
------
* **Acquisition of Relevance Implicatures in Preschool Mandarin-Speaking Children with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder**, Jun 2023 - Present  
Master Thesis Project  
  * Designed a cross-sectional study to measure comprehension of relevance implicatures, theory of mind, and inhibitory control, focusing on how world knowledge, common ground, and pragmatic reasoning contribute to intention inference.
  * Led a team of four research assistants in collecting data from 96 non-autistic preschool children and 20 autistic preschool children. 
  * Applied mixed-effects regression models in R to evaluate the effects of age, degrees of at-issueness (a measure of a response’s relevance to the question under discussion), theory of mind, and inhibitory control on task performance, revealing significant roles for age, degrees of at-issueness, and theory of mind in the non-autistic group.
  * Currently administering tasks to a larger sample of autistic preschool children, matched for chronological age and verbal intelligence with the non-autistic group, to compare relevance implicature development between groups.

* **The Relationship Between Theory of Mind and Listening Comprehension Among Chinese Preschoolers with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder**, Oct 2021 - Jun 2022  
Undergraduate Thesis Project  
  * Explored how theory of mind was directly and indirectly related to listening comprehension in Chinese preschool children with and without autism spectrum disorder. 
  * Led a team of five research assistants to administer linguistic and cognitive tasks to 49 autistic preschool children and 52 non-autistic preschool children, assessing literal and inferential listening comprehension, theory of mind, receptive vocabulary, and non-verbal intelligence.
  * Conducted correlation and mediation analyses using SPSS, finding significant correlations between theory of mind and listening comprehension in both groups.
  * Discussed the findings on the basis of the situation model, providing insights into strategies for improving listening comprehension in autistic and non-autistic preschool children.

* **The Relationship Between Parent Beliefs About Their Children’s English Learning and Their Children’s English Proficiency**, Oct 2020 - Jun 2021  
Undergraduate Research Project Supported by Sun Yat-sen University Training Program of Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Undergraduates  
  * Collected data from 89 Chinese third-grade students and their parents using the Beliefs About Language Learning Inventory to investigate the relationship between parental beliefs about language learning and their children’s English proficiency.
  * Performed correlation analysis on parental education background, parental English proficiency, children’s English learning duration, and children’s English proficiency, revealing that parental education background and English proficiency were positively correlated with children’s English proficiency.
  * Led an intervention program for 36 students and their parents, which provided knowledge-based lectures designed to improve parents’ beliefs about language learning, and compared their outcomes with a control group of 22 student-parent dyads.
  * Conducted t-tests to assess the impact of the intervention program on parental beliefs and children’s English proficiency.

Lab Experience

  * Collected data using a frequency-tagging paradigm from 42 Chinese adults via a 128-channel EEG recording system.
  * Preprocessed EEG data using EEGLAB on MATLAB, including FIR filter, EOG artifact removal, and spike removal.

  * Administered linguistic and cognitive assessments (non-verbal intelligence, receptive vocabulary, phonological awareness, orthographic awareness, rapid automized naming, character recognition, and listening comprehension) to both autistic and non-autistic preschool children.
  * Conducted correlation, mediation, and regression analyses using SPSS on the collected data.
